# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a workbook that I am creating which is a pre-requisite for the bootcamp that I am about to begin. My motivation is that I would like to learn how ot code so that I may change my career from a manager to an individual contributor. This project is helping intorduce me to CSS, JavaScript, SSH, GitHub to nae a few. The problem that this sovles for me is that it moves the starting lines from 0 to 1 so that I do not start the bootcamp with zero knowledge. I learned that I don't know as much as I thought. Some of this has been confusing since the only "coding" language that I have really been introduced to was SQL, albeit years ago. I learned how to do things on my own but it was done for a very specific purpose without really learning or understanding the why behind some of the work that I was doing.
